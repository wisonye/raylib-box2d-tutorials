* How to play audio

** Regular steps to load and play sound/music

Here are the steps you should follow:

- Call ~InitAudioDevice~ to init audio device

- call ~LoadSound~ to create ~Sound~ instance

- call ~LoadMusicStream~ to create ~Music~ instance

- Call ~PlaySound~ to play your sound effect

- Call ~PlayMusicStream, PauseMusicStream, StopMusicStream~ to control your music, make sure to call ~UpdateMusicStream~ in every frame logic to update music buffer

- Optional, if you want to draw a music progress bar, then you need the following code to calculate the played time:

  #+BEGIN_SRC zig
    // Time played normalized [0.0f..1.0f]
    var timePlayed: f32 = 0.0;

    while (is_running) {
        //
        // Update music buffer with new stream data
        //
        rl.UpdateMusicStream(background_music);

        //
        // Get normalized time played for current music stream, used to update
        // progress bar
        //
        timePlayed = rl.GetMusicTimePlayed(background_music) / rl.GetMusicTimeLength(background_music);

        // Make sure time played is no longer than music
        if (timePlayed > 1.0) {
            timePlayed = 1.0;
        }


        rl.BeginDrawing();

        //
        // Background music progress bar
        //
        rl.DrawRectangle(
            200, // x
            180, // y
            @as(c_int, @intFromFloat(timePlayed * 400.0)), // Played time width
            12, // height
            TRON_ORANGE,
        );

        rl.EndDrawing();
    }
  #+END_SRC

- Finally, call ~UnloadMusicStream~, ~UnloadSound~ and ~CloseAudioDevice~ before program closes
